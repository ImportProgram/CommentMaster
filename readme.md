# CommentMaster
CommentMaster is a VB application to comment VB files for Computer Science courses as required for a class. This was designed to parse, generate, and even save the comments for later use. 

Although it has been tested decently well, **ALWAYS BACKUP FILES BEFORE USE**

# Usage
Clone the repo, open the solution in Visual Studio (2022).

1. Load the file with the "Open File" button on the top left. **BACKUP THE FILE YOU SELECT**
2. The file will be parsed

> Keep in mine all `Const` and `Dim` should all have a type like `Dim thing as String`

3. Add comments by selecting the text boxes and tabs you wish to change. Keep in mind even if a Constant, Structure, Global, or a Method is blank, the comments will still be generated. 
4. Check the file. Sometimes comments can break the files, so always double check the output. 
5. Profit, you saved at least 30 minutes on your homework because you did :D
